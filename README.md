# Liquid Collective Security

Liquid Collective recognizes the importance of protecting users' security when using our protocols and products. We understand that secure protocols and products are primordial to maintain the trust users place in us. 

We constantly aim to improve our products and processes, to both serve users' needs for the highest level of security and to preserve users' safety. 

## Security Audits

Liquid Collective has engaged independent security firms Halborn and Spearbit to perform security audits of the protocol. Every protocol feature deployed to mainnet has previously been reviewed by at least one of those teams.
